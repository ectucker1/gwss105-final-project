    <h1>Queer Legal Activism</h1>
    <p>
        There are many visualizations of the current wave of anti-LGBT legislation,
        such as <a href="https://www.aclu.org/legislative-attacks-on-lgbtq-rights">this one from the ACLU</a>.
        These capture important information and are a great tool to stay informed and strategize around legal attacks.
    </p>
    <p>
        But just seeing the ant-queer legislation shows only part of the story.
        Resisting with these laws, there have been a wide variety of lawsuits and other actions by organizations
        such as the <a href="https://www.aclu.org/">ACLU</a> and <a href="https://lambdalegal.org/">Lambda Legal</a>.
    </p>

        The following graphic seeks to highlight some of this work.
        The chart maps lawsuits scraped from the ACLU and Lambda Legal's websites.
