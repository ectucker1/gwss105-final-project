    <h1>LGBT Rights Legal Actions</h1>
    <p>
        There are many data sources tracking of the current wave of anti-queer legislation,
        such as <a href="https://www.aclu.org/legislative-attacks-on-lgbtq-rights">this map from the ACLU</a>
        and <a href="https://www.erininthemorning.com/">Erin Reed's blog</a>.
        These capture important information and are a great tool to stay informed about
        how queer and particularly trans people are being attacked by state legislatures.
    </p>
    <p>
        But just seeing the actions taken by bigoted legislators tells only part of the story.
        There have also been organizations taking legal action to advocate for queer rights,
        such as the <a href="https://www.aclu.org/">ACLU</a> and <a href="https://lambdalegal.org/">Lambda Legal</a>.
        Their work has continued on through many lawsuits challenging current discriminatory legislation.
    </p>
    <p>
        The following graphic seeks to highlight some of this work.
        The chart maps lawsuits and other legal actions programmatically scraped from the ACLU and Lambda Legal's websites.
        Data has not been extensively cleaned up from the scrape, so there may be slight inconsistencies,
        such as dates for certain cases being taken from court fillings rather than more well-known decision dates.
        Source code for both the scraper and this page can be found on <a href="https://github.com/ectucker1/gwss105-final-project/">GitHub</a>.

        The slider below can be used to filter for cases last updated after a certain date.
        Clicking on a state will show the list of cases from that state along with links to the pages they were scraped from,
        which have more context about each case.
